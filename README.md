# QuLab: Transformer Models Visualization

## Project Description
QuLab is an interactive Streamlit application designed to explore the fascinating world of Transformer models, with a specific focus on the self-attention mechanism. This application allows users to visualize attention weights, understand how synthetic data is generated and validated, and gain deeper insights into the "Attention Is All You Need" paradigm.

## Features
- **Self-Attention Visualization**: Analyze how Transformers weigh the importance of different words in a sentence.
- **Multi-Head Attention Visualization**: Explore how multiple attention heads capture diverse relationships in the data.
- **Positional Encoding Visualization**: Understand how positional encodings help Transformers maintain the order of words in a sequence.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly sidebar for input parameters and navigation between different visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this application, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Plotly
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qulab.git
   cd qulab
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit torch transformers plotly pandas numpy
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Basic Usage Instructions
1. **Select a Page**: Use the sidebar to navigate between "Self-Attention Visualization", "Multi-Head Attention", and "Positional Encoding".
2. **Input Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the sidebar to customize the analysis.
3. **Run Analysis**: Click the "Run Analysis" button to generate data and visualize the attention mechanisms.
