# QuLab: Transformer Models Exploration

## Description
QuLab is an interactive Streamlit application designed to explore the fascinating world of Transformer models, focusing specifically on the self-attention mechanism. This application allows users to visualize attention weights, understand how synthetic data is generated and validated, and gain deeper insights into the "Attention Is All You Need" paradigm.

## Features
- **Self-Attention Visualization**: Visualize how self-attention works in Transformer models.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Explore the concept of multi-head attention and its benefits.
- **Positional Encoding**: Understand how positional encoding helps Transformers maintain the order of sequences.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface with sliders and input fields for customization.
- **Data Generation**: Generate synthetic data for testing and visualization purposes.
- **Visualization Tools**: Utilize Plotly for interactive heatmaps of attention weights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Plotly
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qulab.git
   cd qulab
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the interface.

### Basic Usage Instructions
1. Use the sidebar to navigate between different sections: Self-Attention Visualization, Multi-Head Attention, and Positional Encoding.
2. Adjust the parameters such as vocabulary size, maximum sentence length, and number of sentences using the sliders.
3. Enter a sentence for analysis or generate synthetic data by leaving the input field empty.
4. Click the "Run Analysis" button to visualize the attention weights or positional encodings.
