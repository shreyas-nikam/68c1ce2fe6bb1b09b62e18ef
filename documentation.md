# Codelab for QuLab: Understanding Transformer Models

## Introduction to the Application
Duration: 0:10

In this codelab, we will explore the QuLab Streamlit application, which provides an interactive platform to visualize and understand the self-attention mechanism of Transformer models. Transformers have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by enabling models to process sequences of data efficiently and effectively. This application allows users to delve into the intricacies of how Transformers weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, visualize attention weights, and understand the underlying principles of synthetic data generation and validation.

The key functionalities of this application include:
- **Self-Attention Visualization**: Understanding how individual words in a sentence interact with each other through attention weights.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Exploring how multiple attention heads can capture diverse relationships within the data.
- **Positional Encoding**: Learning how Transformers maintain the order of words in a sequence.

By the end of this codelab, you will have a comprehensive understanding of these concepts and how they are implemented in the QuLab application.

## Setting Up the Application
Duration: 0:05

To get started with the QuLab application, you need to have Python and Streamlit installed. You can install Streamlit using pip:

```console
pip install streamlit
```

Once you have Streamlit installed, you can run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

```console
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your web browser, where you can navigate through the different functionalities.

## Self-Attention Visualization
Duration: 0:20

### Overview
The self-attention mechanism is a key component of Transformer models, allowing them to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. In this section, we will visualize how self-attention works using the QuLab application.

### Functionality
1. **Input Parameters**: Users can input a sentence for analysis or generate synthetic data by specifying the vocabulary size, maximum sentence length, and the number of sentences.
2. **Data Generation**: The application generates synthetic sentences using the `generate_synthetic_data` function, which creates random sequences of integers representing words.
3. **Attention Weight Calculation**: The self-attention mechanism is implemented in the `SelfAttention` class, which computes attention weights based on the input embeddings.

### Visualization
After running the analysis, the application displays a heatmap of the attention weights, where:
- The x-axis represents the keys (words being attended to).
- The y-axis represents the queries (words attending).

This visualization helps users understand how different words in a sentence influence each other.

### Example Code
Here is a snippet of the code responsible for self-attention visualization:

```python
class SelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, head_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.query = nn.Linear(embed_dim, head_dim)
        self.key = nn.Linear(embed_dim, head_dim)
        self.value = nn.Linear(embed_dim, head_dim)

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        Q = self.query(x)
        K = self.key(x)
        V = self.value(x)
        attention_scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1)) / (self.head_dim ** 0.5)
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1)
        output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
        return output, attention_weights
```

## Multi-Head Attention Visualization
Duration: 0:20

### Overview
Multi-Head Attention extends the self-attention mechanism by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. This section will explore how Multi-Head Attention works and its significance in Transformer models.

### Functionality
1. **Input Parameters**: Similar to self-attention, users can input a sentence or generate synthetic data. Additionally, users can specify the number of attention heads.
2. **Attention Weight Calculation**: The `MultiHeadSelfAttention` class computes attention weights for each head, allowing the model to capture diverse relationships.

### Visualization
The application displays separate heatmaps for each attention head, enabling users to observe how different heads focus on various aspects of the input.

### Example Code
Here is a snippet of the code responsible for multi-head attention:

```python
class MultiHeadSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.heads = nn.ModuleList([SelfAttention(embed_dim, embed_dim // num_heads) for _ in range(num_heads)])

    def forward(self, x, mask=None):
        all_head_outputs = [head(x, mask) for head in self.heads]
        concatenated_output = torch.cat(all_head_outputs, dim=-1)
        return self.output_linear(concatenated_output)
```

## Positional Encoding Visualization
Duration: 0:20

### Overview
Positional encoding is crucial for Transformers as it provides information about the position of words in a sequence. This section will explain how positional encoding works and its implementation in the QuLab application.

### Functionality
1. **Input Parameters**: Users can specify the maximum sequence length and embedding dimension for positional encoding.
2. **Positional Encoding Calculation**: The `get_positional_encoding` function generates positional encodings using sine and cosine functions.

### Visualization
The application displays a heatmap of the positional encodings, where:
- Each row corresponds to a position in the sequence.
- Each column corresponds to a dimension in the embedding.

### Example Code
Here is a snippet of the code responsible for positional encoding:

```python
def get_positional_encoding(max_len, embed_dim):
    pe = torch.zeros(max_len, embed_dim)
    position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
    div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, embed_dim, 2).float() * (-(np.log(10000.0) / embed_dim)))
    pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
    pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
    return pe
```
